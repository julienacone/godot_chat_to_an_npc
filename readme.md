# ðŸ§™ AI Wizard Interaction

This project lets you talk to a wise wizard NPC in your Godot 4.x game, with responses generated by an AI model running in Python using Hugging Face Transformers.

## Project Overview

On the Godot side, a GDScript node continuously checks for user input via a helper node named **Read Input and Write**. When the player submits text and no thread is running, it spawns a new `Thread` that launches the Python backend. This keeps your game loop smooth and non-blocking.

The Python script loads the `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B` model and watches a file called `read/input.txt`. Every two seconds, up to fifty times, it reads that file. If the content has changed since the last check, it constructs a prompt asking the model to reply as a wise wizardâ€”explicitly instructing it not to repeat itselfâ€”and sends it through the Hugging Face pipeline.

Once the model returns its text, the script strips out the prompt prefix and the original input, then truncates the reply to roughly one or two sentences by looking for punctuation marks (`.`, `!`, `?`). That cleaned answer is written to `read/output.txt` for Godot to read and display.

You can also expand the wizardâ€™s personality by tweaking the prompt, or maintain a conversation history in memory or on disk for more context.

## Requirements

- **Godot Engine 4.x**  
- **Python 3.8+**  
- Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install torch transformers
  ```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Install Python dependencies.  
3. Open your Godot project; ensure the `read/` folder exists with `input.txt` and `output.txt`.  
4. Run the Godot chat scene.

## Tips & Extensions

- Tweak the prompt in `chat.py` to alter your wizardâ€™s tone (cryptic, playful, stern).  
- Persist conversation history for more contextual replies.

May your wizardâ€™s guidance be ever insightful and your code bug-free!
